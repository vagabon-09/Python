# Python Notes
- To comment a line use `#`
- Multiline comment use `""" comment """`
- Assign value in variable `variable_name = value`
- To display use `print()`  [Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Class/print.py)
- To scan value from user use `input()`  [Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Class/scan.py)


### Condition
- To use if condition use `if condition : code else: code`  [Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Class/IfCondition.py) 
- To use else if condition or nested if use `if condition: code elif condition: code else: code`  [Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Class/ElseIf.py)


### Loop
- To use for loop use `for variable_name in array_name: print(variable_name)`  [Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Class/ForLoop.py)


### String
- Declear String `string_name = "string"` [Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Lab/String/PrintString.py)
- Print String `print(string_name)`[Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Lab/String/PrintString.py)
- Print targeted letter numbers in string `string_name.count('target_letter')` [Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Lab/String/NumberOfLetter.py)
- Check length of the string `len(string_name)`[Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Lab/String/LengthString.py)
- Print string in customise way `string_name[start:end:difference]`[Example](https://github.com/vagabon-09/Python/blob/master/Lab/String/PrintString2.py)
